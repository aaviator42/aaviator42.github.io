### Hello, World?

I used to blog as a tween. Well, I used to set up blogs for myself. I never actually posted on them much. I guess tinkering with obscure PHP CMSs was a lot more fun than actually writing and publishing content, lmao.

Anyway, here I am, many years later, a GMAP*, ready to give this another shot. This blog is very possibly going to become another way for me to procrastinate on stuff I should actually be focusing on.

Simple good ol' Github Pages this time.

I don't really know what I'll be blogging about here. Heh, that's such a 2004 thing to say. Maybe I'll talk about my projects. Or about cool stuff that I find on the internet. Webcomics? Music? Dunno.


Anyway. See y'all around.
